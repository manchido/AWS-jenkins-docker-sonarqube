# AWS-jenkins-docker-sonarqube

### Jenkins 
Used in automating the build and deployment to docker. 
### Github  
Version control and collaboration. 
### Sonarqube  
For code analysis. Tool that helps analyze and manage code quality in software projects. 
### Docker  
Containerization of software build for deployment.

## STEPS

First, we will create an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins on it. We will then set up a Github repository and integrate it with Jenkins. Next, we will 
configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in our Github repository. Finally, we will create a Docker image of our application and deploy it using Jenkins.

For the project, three(3) EC2 instances were used for jenkins, SonarQube and Docker respectively. The general aim was to create a working CI/CD pipeline that 
will help automate the software development process and ensure the quality of code.
